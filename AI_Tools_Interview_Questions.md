### Question 2: AI Agents and Automation
**Q:** AI agents can perform autonomous tasks like debugging, refactoring, or even implementing features. How would you use an AI agent in your current .NET projects? What tasks would you delegate to an agent vs. do manually, and why?

**Expected Answer:**
"AI agents are powerful for autonomous coding tasks. Here's how I'd leverage them:

**Tasks I'd Delegate to AI Agents:**

1. **Boilerplate Code Generation**:
   - Creating CRUD operations for new entities
   - Generating repository interfaces and implementations
   - Building API controllers with standard endpoints
   - Creating DTOs and mapping profiles (AutoMapper)

2. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Converting synchronous code to async/await patterns
   - Applying SOLID principles to existing code
   - Extracting interfaces from concrete classes
   - Renaming variables/methods across the codebase

3. **Testing**:
   - Generating unit test templates with xUnit/NUnit
   - Creating mock objects with Moq
   - Writing integration test scaffolding

4. **Documentation**:
   - Generating XML comments
   - Creating API documentation
   - Writing inline code comments

5. **Bug Analysis**:
   - Analyzing stack traces
   - Identifying potential null reference issues
   - Suggesting fixes for common exceptions

**Tasks I'd Do Manually:**

1. **Architecture Decisions**: Choosing between patterns, designing system structure
2. **Business Logic**: Core domain logic requires human understanding
3. **Security Implementation**: Authentication, authorization, sensitive data handling
4. **Performance Optimization**: Profiling and optimization need human judgment
5. **Code Review & Quality**: Final approval always needs human oversight
6. **Database Design**: Schema design and migration strategies
7. **Third-party Integration**: APIs, payment gateways, external services

**Why This Separation?**

- AI agents excel at repetitive, pattern-based tasks
- Human developers are better at understanding business context
- Security and performance need human expertise and judgment
- Critical decisions need accountability
- Complex problem-solving requires creative thinking

**In my .NET projects specifically:**
I'd use an AI agent to scaffold a new microservice with all standard patterns (repositories, services, controllers, tests), but I'd manually implement the business logic, configure dependency injection properly, handle error scenarios, and optimize database queries based on actual usage patterns.

The goal is to let AI handle the tedious work so I can focus on solving complex problems and delivering business value."

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- ✅ Clear understanding of AI agent capabilities
- ✅ Realistic task delegation
- ✅ Strong reasoning for manual vs. automated tasks
- ✅ Security and quality awareness

### Question 3: LLM Understanding and Selection
**Q:** Different Large Language Models (LLMs) power different AI coding tools. What factors would you consider when choosing between AI tools powered by different models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Code Llama)? How would this impact your .NET development work?

**Expected Answer:**
"Choosing the right LLM for development work involves several factors:

**1. Context Window Size:**
- GPT-4 Turbo: 128K tokens - great for understanding large codebases
- Claude 3: Up to 200K tokens - excellent for analyzing entire files
- Code Llama: Smaller context but fast
- **Impact on .NET**: When refactoring large legacy .NET applications, larger context windows help AI understand relationships between multiple files, dependency injection configurations, and architectural patterns.

**2. Code Understanding & Generation Quality:**
- **GPT-4**: Excellent for general-purpose coding, good with C# and .NET patterns
- **Claude**: Strong at following instructions precisely, great for complex refactoring
- **Code Llama**: Optimized specifically for code, faster inference
- **Impact**: For .NET-specific patterns like Entity Framework configurations, LINQ queries, or ASP.NET Core middleware, I'd prefer models trained heavily on C# codebases.

**3. Speed vs. Quality Trade-off:**
- Faster models (Code Llama, smaller GPT variants): Good for autocomplete, real-time suggestions
- Slower, more powerful models (GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus): Better for complex code generation
- **Impact**: For quick autocomplete in Visual Studio via Copilot, speed matters. For generating entire service classes or complex business logic in Cursor, quality matters more.

**4. Cost Considerations:**
- API costs vary significantly between models
- For large teams, cost per token matters
- **Impact**: In enterprise .NET development, balancing cost with productivity gains is crucial.

**5. Specialization:**
- Some models are fine-tuned for specific languages
- GitHub Copilot's Codex is trained extensively on GitHub code
- **Impact**: For .NET specifically, models trained on large C# repositories understand common patterns like dependency injection, async/await, and LINQ better.

**6. Privacy & Security:**
- Some tools don't send code to external servers
- Enterprise versions offer better data protection
- **Impact**: In my experience with enterprise applications (Pension domain, Public Safety domain), code confidentiality is critical. I'd choose tools with on-premises options or strict data policies.

**7. Multi-Language Support:**
- .NET projects often involve C#, JavaScript/TypeScript (Blazor), SQL, JSON, XML
- **Impact**: I need models that understand frontend (Blazor/Razor), backend (C#), and database (Entity Framework, SQL) code together.

**Practical Selection for .NET Development:**

- **For daily coding**: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4 based) - great balance of speed and quality
- **For complex refactoring**: Cursor with Claude 3 - excellent at following detailed instructions
- **For code review**: GPT-4 - good at explaining code and finding issues
- **For learning new patterns**: Claude - provides detailed explanations

**Real-world Example:**
When migrating a legacy .NET Framework application to .NET 8, I'd use:
- Cursor with Claude 3 for analyzing large legacy files and planning migration
- GitHub Copilot for day-to-day coding during implementation
- GPT-4 API for batch processing and documentation generation

The key is understanding that no single model is perfect for everything. The best approach is using the right tool for each task in your development workflow."

### Question 4: Code Quality and AI
**Q:** AI tools can generate code quickly, but how do you ensure the generated code meets quality standards? Describe your approach to reviewing, testing, and improving AI-generated .NET code.

**Expected Answer:**
"Ensuring AI-generated code meets quality standards is critical. Here's my comprehensive approach:

**1. Immediate Code Review:**

When AI generates code, I review for:
- **Correctness**: Does it solve the actual problem?
- **Syntax**: Is it valid C#? Does it compile?
- **Logic Errors**: Are there edge cases or null reference issues?
- **Framework Version**: Is it using the correct .NET version APIs?

Example: AI might generate EF Core code using `.Find()` when `.FindAsync()` is more appropriate for async operations.

**2. Architecture & Design Review:**

Check if AI-generated code follows:
- **SOLID Principles**: Single Responsibility, Dependency Inversion, etc.
- **Design Patterns**: Repository pattern, Factory pattern, etc.
- **Project Architecture**: Layered architecture, Clean Architecture, etc.
- **Dependency Injection**: Proper DI configuration

Example: AI might create a service class that directly instantiates dependencies instead of using constructor injection.

**3. .NET Best Practices:**

Verify adherence to:
- **Async/Await**: Proper async patterns, avoid blocking calls
- **IDisposable**: Proper disposal of resources using `using` statements
- **Exception Handling**: Try-catch blocks in appropriate places
- **Logging**: Proper logging implementation (ILogger)
- **Configuration**: appsettings.json usage, options pattern

Example: AI might forget to use `ConfigureAwait(false)` in library code or might not implement proper cancellation token support.

**4. Security Review:**

Critical checks:
- **SQL Injection**: Ensure parameterized queries, not string concatenation
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Proper [Authorize] attributes, claims validation
- **Input Validation**: Data annotations, FluentValidation
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials, use Azure Key Vault or User Secrets
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS policies

Example: AI might generate a SQL query using string interpolation instead of parameterized queries.

**5. Performance Review:**

Analyze for:
- **N+1 Queries**: Check EF Core queries for proper includes
- **Async Performance**: Avoid `Task.Result` or `.Wait()` which cause deadlocks
- **Memory Leaks**: Proper disposal, avoid capturing large objects in closures
- **Caching**: Appropriate use of IMemoryCache or distributed cache

Example: AI might generate an EF query that loads entire tables into memory instead of using pagination.

**6. Testing Strategy:**

I write tests for AI-generated code:

```csharp
// Unit Tests
[Fact]
public async Task GetProductById_ValidId_ReturnsProduct()
{
    // Arrange - Mock dependencies
    var mockRepo = new Mock<IProductRepository>();
    mockRepo.Setup(r => r.GetByIdAsync(1))
            .ReturnsAsync(new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Test" });
    
    var service = new ProductService(mockRepo.Object);
    
    // Act
    var result = await service.GetProductAsync(1);
    
    // Assert
    Assert.NotNull(result);
    Assert.Equal("Test", result.Name);
}

// Integration Tests
[Fact]
public async Task ProductApi_CreateProduct_ReturnsCreated()
{
    // Test actual API endpoint with test database
}
```

**7. Static Code Analysis:**

Use tools in Visual Studio:
- **Code Analysis**: Enable Roslyn analyzers
- **StyleCop**: Enforce coding standards
- **SonarLint**: Detect bugs and code smells
- **Visual Studio Metrics**: Check complexity and maintainability

**8. Refactoring AI Code:**

Common improvements I make:
- Extract magic numbers into constants
- Break large methods into smaller ones
- Add proper XML documentation comments
- Improve variable naming
- Add defensive programming checks

**9. Manual Testing:**

In Visual Studio Enterprise:
- **Debugging**: Step through AI-generated code
- **Breakpoints**: Verify logic at critical points
- **Watch Window**: Inspect variable values
- **Exception Settings**: Catch exceptions AI might miss

**10. Team Review:**

- **Pull Request**: Let team review AI-generated code
- **Pair Programming**: Discuss AI suggestions with colleagues
- **Code Review Checklist**: Standard checks for all code

**Real-World Example:**

AI generated this repository method:

```csharp
// AI Generated (PROBLEMATIC)
public Product GetProduct(int id)
{
    return _context.Products.Find(id);
}
```

Issues I identified and fixed:
1. Not async (performance issue)
2. No null check (NullReferenceException risk)
3. No exception handling
4. Not tracking-free for read-only operations
5. No logging

**My Improved Version:**

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves a product by its identifier asynchronously.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="id">The product identifier.</param>
/// <param name="cancellationToken">Cancellation token.</param>
/// <returns>The product if found; otherwise, null.</returns>
public async Task<Product?> GetProductAsync(
    int id, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    try
    {
        _logger.LogInformation(
            "Retrieving product with ID: {ProductId}", id);
        
        var product = await _context.Products
            .AsNoTracking()
            .FirstOrDefaultAsync(
                p => p.Id == id, 
                cancellationToken);
        
        if (product == null)
        {
            _logger.LogWarning(
                "Product not found: {ProductId}", id);
        }
        
        return product;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, 
            "Error retrieving product: {ProductId}", id);
        throw;
    }
}
```

**Conclusion:**

AI is a powerful tool for accelerating development, but it's not a replacement for engineering judgment. Every line of AI-generated code should be treated like code from a junior developer - helpful but requiring review, testing, and often improvement. The combination of AI speed and human quality control creates the best results."
